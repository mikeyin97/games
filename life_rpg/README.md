# Life RPG

A quick RPG about my life. 

To start the game:

1) Clone the repository.
2) Navigate this folder.
5) Install dependencies with `npm install`.
6) Start the application with `npm run start`.
5) The game should run on localhost:2000.


### Controls

Arrow Keys to move, Z to interact. You can interact with things that have a red diamond above them. 

## Some Notes

The code for this game is really bad, I definitely gotta go back and refactor some stuff in the future.
