# Phaser Tutorial

I followed [this tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/index) but I added some major experimental features (double jumping, multiplayer, shooting)

To start the game:

1) Clone the repository.
2) Navigate this folder.
5) Install dependencies with `npm install`.
6) Start the application with `npm run start`.
5) The game should run on localhost:2000.


### Controls
Player 1: WASD movements, F to shoot.
Player 2: up/down/left/right movement, M to shoot. 


### To add
1) Online Multiplayer
2) Start Menu Screen
    a) Char Selection
    b) Stage Selection
3) Zoom in on death
4) Moving Platforms
