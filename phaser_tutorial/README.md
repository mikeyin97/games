# Phaser Tutorial

I followed [this tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/index) but I added some major experimental features (double jumping, multiplayer, shooting)

To start the game:

1) Clone the repository.
2) Navigate this folder.
5) Install dependencies with `npm install`.
6) Start the application with `npm run start`.
5) The game should run on localhost:2000.
